This is a tutorial based on the VSD Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130 Workshop. The workshop took place over a 5-day period in April 2021. 

OpenLANE is a RTL to GDSII flow which includes several open source tools including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic and Fault. Sky130 is an open source PDK created by Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry for 130nm packages. A PDK, or process design kit, is the interface between fabricators and designers. It consists of files containing information about the design flow, such as process design rules (DRC, LVS and Physical Extraction), device models, digital standard cell libraries, I/O libraries and more. RTL IPs and EDA tools are required along with PDKs for a complete ASIC RTL to GDSII design flow. RTL designs can be found on librecores.org, opencores.org and github. Open source EDA tools include Qflow and OpenROAD.
